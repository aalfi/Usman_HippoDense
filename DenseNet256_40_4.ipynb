    "# Occlusion sensitivity\n",
    "One method for trying to visualise why the network made a given prediction is occlusion sensitivity. We occlude part of the image, and see how the probability of a given prediction changes. We then iterate over the image, moving the occluded portion as we go, and in doing so we build up a sensitivity map detailing which areas were the most important in making the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bounds\n",
    "If we were to test the occlusion centred on all voxels in our image, we would have to do `torch.prod(im.shape) = 96^3 = ~1e6` predictions. We can use the bounding box to only to the estimations in a region of interest, for example over one slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we simply give the bounding box as `(minC,maxC,minD,maxD,minH,maxH,minW,maxW)`. We can use `-1` for any value to use its full extent (`0` and `im.shape-1` for min's and max's, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "The output image in this example will look fairly bad, since our network hasn't been trained for very long. Training for longer should improve the quality of the occlusion map."
